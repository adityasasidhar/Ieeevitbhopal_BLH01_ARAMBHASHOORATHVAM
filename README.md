The topic of our project through the fishbowl selection was given as Empowering Women in STEM
we all realise that one or the other way women always have to take a back seat when being presented with career oppurtunities and this has led to 
major setbacks for women in STEM fields where there is plenty of opputunities for all genders.

Taking into the account all the drawbacks and hurdles in the way of women we have sougth to create a platform where women can actively participate together to
to push each others through their validate each opinions and to overcome challenges like misinformations, miscommunications etc.

like they say
  "Girls get is done"
